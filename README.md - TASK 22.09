# prowly-task
Prowly task

Prepare 3 test cases for the following scenarios (select the "most interesting" cases in your opinion):

A) Searching for "prowly" on google.com, filtering by content category (everything, video, news, etc.).

B) Searching for the word "prowly" on google.com with filtering by date.

Save test cases in a text file (with the TXT extension) in English.
The syntax is free, but write in such a way that the script can be easily updated by other testers on the team.

Share the directory with the file as a code repository on Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket (it's best to visualize the progress of work by "committing" changes from time to time).
